Algorithms for (Quadratic) Time-Frequency Distributions
=======================================================

This collection of M-files generate time-frequency distributions
(TFDs) with as few computations and as little memory as possible.
The algorithms are described in [[1]](#references); the discrete TFD definition
they compute is in [[2]](#references).  

There are two sets of algorithms.  The first set (Set1) computes
the exact TFD and minimises on oversampling.  The second set (Set2)
computes a decimated TFD, and therefore is not exact but may be
useful for some applications.

Each set computes four different types of kernels:
- nonseparable kernel
- separable kernel
- Doppler-independent kernel
- lag-independent kernel 
  (see [[1]](#references) for more details)
  
The code is organised as follows:
- folder `full_DTFD` contains the first set of algorithms (computes
  exact TFDs)
- folder `dec_DTFD` contains the second set of algorithms (computes
  decimated TFDs)
- folder `common` and `utils` contain extra functions used by both
  algorithm sets.

These programs should run in either Matlab (v7.9.0) or Octave
(v3.2.4)


## Quick Start
To start, load the paths:

```matlab
>> load_paths_DTFDs;
```

Next, generate a test signal:

```matlab
>> N=128; x=gen_LFM(N,0.1,0.3);
```

Second, generate a TFD with a separable kernel:

```matlab
>> tf=dtfd_sep1(x,{51,'hamm',0,1},{171,'hann'},256,128); 
```

Third, plot the TFD:

```matlab
>> vtfd(tf,x);
```

## Description

1. functions to compute exact TFDs (in folder 'full_DTFD'):
   - `dtfd_DI.m` computes a TFD with Doppler-independent kernel
   - `dtfd_LI.m` computes a TFD with a lag-independent kernel
   - `dtfd_nonsep.m` computes a nonseparable-kernel TFD
   - `dtfd_sep1.m` computes a TFD with a separable kernel
   - `dtfd_sep2.m` computes a TFD with a separable kernel using a
     different algorithm to the `dtfd_sep1.m`

2. functions to compute a decimated TFD (in folder `dec_DTFD`)
   - `dec_dtfd_DI.m` computes a decimated TFD with a
     Doppler-independent kernel
   - `dec_dtfd_LI.m` computes a decimated TFD with a
     lag-independent kernel
   - `dec_dtfd_nonsep.m` computes a decimated TFD with a
     nonseparable kernel
   - `dec_dtfd_sep.m` computes a decimated TFD with a separable kernel
   - `dwvd_grid1.m` computes a decimated Wigner-Ville distribution
   - `dwvd_grid2.m` computes a decimated Wigner-Ville distribution
     with a different decimation grid to that grid in
     `dwvd_grid1.m`

3. Other miscellaneous functions (in folder `utils`) include:
   - `get_analytic.m` computes a discrete analytic signal, as
     defined in [[3]](#references) 
   - `gen_LFM.m` computes a linear frequency modulated (LFM) signal
   - `fft_complex.m` is a function for alternative FFT routines
     (for example to take advantage of parallel computing);
     likewise are `fft_conj_summ.m`, `ifft_complex.m`, and `ifft_conj_symm.m`

# Examples
In all the examples, start by adding the paths by running the command

 ```matlab
 >> load_paths_DTFDs;
 ```

1. Choi-Williams using the exact TFD algorithm (from Set1 [[1]](#references)):

    ```matlab
    % 1. generate test signal:
    N=256; 
    x=gen_LFM(N,0.05,0.15)+gen_LFM(N,0.2,0.35);
    % 2. generate TFD
    c=dtfd_nonsep(x,'cw',{30}); 
    % 3. plot
    clf; vtfd(c,x);
	  ```

2. Separable-kernel TFD using exact TFD algorithm (from Set1 [[1]](#references))

	  ```matlab
    % 1. generate test signal:
    N=10000; 
    x=gen_LFM(N,0.1,0.3)+gen_LFM(N,0.4,0.1);
    % 2. generate TFD
    Ntime=256; Nfreq=256;
    c=dtfd_sep1(x,{51,'hamm',0,1},{271,'hann'},Ntime,Nfreq); 
    % 3. plot
    clf; vtfd(c,x);
	  ```

3. Doppler-independent kernel TFD using decimated TFD algorithm
   (from Set2 [[1]](#references)) generating selective time portions of the
   signal:

	  ```matlab
    % 1. generate test signal:
    N=171; 
    x=gen_LFM(N,0.1,0.4);
    % 2. generate TFD:
    Nfreq=258; 
    time_dec=[20:3:160,191:250,255,256]; freq_dec=3;
    tf=dec_dtfd_DI(x,{51,'hamm'},Nfreq,time_dec,freq_dec); 
    % 3. plot
    clf; vtfd(tf);
	  ```

4. Separable kernel TFD using decimated TFD algorithm from Set2 [[2]](#references)

    ```matlab
    % 1. generate test signal:
    N=10000; 
    x=gen_LFM(N,0.1,0.3)+gen_LFM(N,0.4,0.1);
    % 2. generate TFD:
    Ntime=512; Nfreq=256;
    time_dec=4; freq_dec=2;
    c=dec_dtfd_sep(x,{51,'hamm',0,1},{271,'hann'}, ...
                   Ntime,Nfreq,time_dec,freq_dec); 
    % 3. plot
    clf; vtfd(c,x);
	  ```
